## Project Overview

A simple personal budget application using JavaScript fundamentals. The app will track income and expenses, calculate the balance, and manage financial transactions - all without using advanced concepts like higher-order functions or callbacks.

Core functionality 
-- Add Income and expense transactions
--Track Total balance(income - expenses)
--List all transactions
--Delete transactions


Data Structure 

### The Transaction Array

The core of the app will be an array that stores all transactions. Each transaction will be represented as an object with these properties:

// Example transaction array structure
let transactions = [
  { type: "income", amount: 1000, description: "Salary" },
  { type: "expense", amount: 200, description: "Groceries" }
];


### Key Variables

You'll need several key variables to manage the application state:

- **transactions**: Array to store all transaction objects
- **balance**: Number to track the current balance
- **totalIncome**: Number to track the sum of all income
- **totalExpenses**: Number to track the sum of all expenses
